# misc scripts

* renamejpg.sh: to rename all prefix of jpg files in the given directory. I usually use a prefix of filename as a "tag" to search as  important keyword. So instead of "IMG_xxx.jpg", it is more meaningful to name it as "Keyword_xxx.jpg"

* mp3-to-mp4-to-youtube.sh: to convert mp3 files to mp4 (using a random image) and upload these files to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DhammaFromForest). The dhamma talks by [Ajahn Martin](http://www.forestdhammatalks.org/en/ajahn_martin/biography.php) on Youtube generated from this script can be found under [Dhamma FromForest](https://www.youtube.com/user/DhammaFromForest).
